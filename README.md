Image processing and facial analysis has been an important research field which aims to
identify human faces and found its use in various different fields for examples in security. The
reasons for this trend are; first it’s the wide range of law enforcement applications and the second
availability of feasible technologies after many years of research. Face recognition and detection
is still a difficult challenge and there is no unique method that provides an effective solution to
all situations face processing may encounter. Face recognition is a computer vision that has an
ability to capture the face from the database automatically. Face recognition can be seen as a way
for systems to begin to understand human face and thus building a bridge between machines and
human. Face recognition is one of biometric methods, to identify given face image using main
features of face.
