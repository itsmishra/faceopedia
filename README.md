Image processing and facial analysis has been an important research field which aims to
identify human faces and found its use in various different fields for examples in security. The
reasons for this trend are; first it’s the wide range of law enforcement applications and the second
availability of feasible technologies after many years of research. Face recognition and detection
is still a difficult challenge and there is no unique method that provides an effective solution to
all situations face processing may encounter. Face recognition is a computer vision that has an
ability to capture the face from the database automatically. Face recognition can be seen as a way
for systems to begin to understand human face and thus building a bridge between machines and
human. Face recognition is one of biometric methods, to identify given face image using main
features of face.

Objectives
• More attractive UI for customers in addition to for users from different level.
• Sorting of photos according to their faces peoples and objects them in searching a
particular photo.
• This platform not only allow user to sort photos but share photos and secure many
resources.
• Helpful in adapting new environment related to technology and with sorting photos
from any folder as per user.
• Users can receive automatic sorting of photos once the folder path has been justified
delivered straight to their desktop application to help them stay updated.

System Design
We proposed a desktop application for users. The innovative system permits users to
sort pictures according to their need and to tag people according to their requirement. As
with this platform a user can easily get separate out images that help to find a particular
image in a list. The platform developed by us will consider user as people from all fields.
Users can easily select a folder location and then easily sort out images on basis of
people, objects etc.
Application which separates out individual images according to people, places and
things. This module has collection of images that has been selected from a folder by the
user. This module also helps in collection of photos from the system. Once users open the
application the user first sees the home module where there various photos from a
particular folder that user has been selected for folder synced.
